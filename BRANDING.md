- **Tagline:** "Personalization, Engineered."
- **Vibe:** Clean studio + industrial chic + Gen-Z neon energy
- **The Formula:** Clinical white backdrop + mirror chrome hardware + neon/pastel products that POP

## 🏗️ Store Environment — "The Backdrop"

The store is the shell. Keep it clean so the products explode.

| Element | Material / Color | Visual Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Primary Base | Bright White | Gallery-like canvas, maximizes light |
| Primary Metal | Mirror Chrome | Racks, shelving, signage — industrial-chic |
| Accent | Powder Blue / Baby Pink | Soft pastels on walls/signage headers — keeps it friendly |
| Texture | Iridescent Film | On glass/acrylic surfaces — shifting "oil slick" glow |

---

## 👕 Product Palette — "The Bold Core"

Products are the stars. They must be impossible to miss.

- **Neon Vibrants** — Neon Poppy, Electric Grape, Hot Coral, Acid Lime
- **Neon Pastels** — Soft Lilac, Peach Fizz, Baby Blue, Mint Cloud
- **White Gen-Z** — Clean white base with bold neon embroidery/accents

### The Contrast Rule (BTV-inspired)
Always pair a **bold product color** with a **neutral metallic**:
- Neon Poppy tote → displayed on polished Chrome hook
- Electric Grape embroidery → on Powder Blue hoodie
- Hot Coral cap → against bright white wall with chrome fixtures

## ✨ Visual Execution Rules

### Photography Style
- **Backdrop:** Bright white or light grey — clinical, gallery-like
- **NOT warm, NOT golden hour** — cool, balanced natural daylight
- **iPhone editorial quality** — must NOT look AI-generated
- **Products are the hero** — let neon colors explode against clean backgrounds
- **Real Filipino person** — authentic emotion, natural pose
- **Every image has:** "Project Perci PH" logo — small, chrome/white, bottom-right corner

### Typography
- **Style:** Bold, wide Sans-Serif — Gen-Z "clunky-chic"
- **Color:** Chrome foil or Black (cuts through neon product colors)
- **Placement:** Technical — small text bottom corner of tote, back neck of hoodie, sleeve edge

### Text Overlay (Social Posts)
- Clean white hook text on dark gradient scrim
- Orange #FF7A00 accent bar (left edge) — the one brand pop color
- No clutter — maximum 2 lines of text + logo

- **Day 30:** First promotional post
- **Carousel spec:** 1080×1080px square, cool-toned, clean white/chrome backdrop
- **Every slide:** Real person + emotion + text overlay + branding
- **Embroidery = creative art:** pet portraits, vectorized faces, couple silhouettes — not just names
