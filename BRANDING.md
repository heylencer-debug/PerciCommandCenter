## 🎯 Brand Identity

- **Name:** PROJECT PERCI (always caps, bold, wide font)
- **Tagline:** "Personalization, Engineered."
- **Vibe:** Techno-Utilitarian — treat every personalized gift like a piece of industrial engineering
- **Logo:** Stripped back — just PROJECT PERCI in a wide, bold sans-serif font

---

## 🎨 Color Palette (BTV-Inspired)

| Base (Industrial) | The "Pop" (Vibrant) | BTV Feel |
|---|---|---|
| Cool Slate / Silver | Electric Blue | Modern, clean, professional |
| Deep Moss / Charcoal | Neon Orange | Rugged, utility-wear aesthetic |
| Off-White / Cream | Cobalt | Classic BTV "Studio" look |

> **Pro Tip:** Use **Silver Chrome** as your neutral. Instead of black or white, use reflective metallic silver — it bridges tech and style.

## 📸 Photo/Content Style

- **NOT warm, NOT golden-filtered** — cool, balanced natural daylight
- **iPhone shot quality** — must NOT look AI-generated
- **Editorial lifestyle feel** — real Filipino person + emotion + product
- **Text overlays** — always a combination of: Person + Text + Branding
- **Every image must have:** "Project Perci PH" logo, white bold, bottom-right corner

---

## 🏗️ Store Vibe: "The Clean Laboratory"

- **Materials:** Galvanized steel or brushed aluminum display racks — no wood
- **Pop Block:** One solid high-gloss vibrant wall (Cobalt Blue or Safety Orange)
- **Show the machine:** Embroidery machine behind clear acrylic — make the process the art
- **Feel:** Futuristic playground, assembled not built

---

## 🧵 Product Strategy: "Precision Customization"

1. **Signature Tag:** Bold blue woven label — "PERCI CUSTOMIZED [01]" + customer name engraved on metal clip
2. **Industrial Embroidery:** Heavy blocky sans-serif font — looks like a serial number, not a pretty monogram
3. **The Hardware Look:** Chrome carabiner or metallic grommet on bags/towels for functional BTV edge

---

## 📦 Packaging: "The Tech Gift"

- **Bag/Box:** Translucent matte plastic or silver foil mailer
- **Sticker:** Large wrap-around sticker in vibrant color, logo in bold black text sealing the package

---

## 📱 Social Media Content Rules

- **Audience:** Gift-givers — NOT embroidery craft people
- **This month (pre-launch):** Educational only — Days 1–29
- **Day 30:** First promotional post
- **Carousel spec:** 1080×1080px square, cool-toned, editorial
- **Every slide:** Real person + emotion + text overlay + branding
- **Embroidery shown as creative art:** pet portraits, couple silhouettes, vectorized faces — not just names

---

## ✒️ Tone of Voice

- Confident, clean, precise
- "Engineered" not "cute"
- Speaks to the gift-giver's desire to impress and be remembered
- Filipino context, Cebu-first
